Dear All,

Kindly share your comments regarding the user stories here!

As a user
I want to rate the dictionary after using it
so that the developers could update dictionary based on my feedback
As the Product Owner I need to know which User Stories are feasible for you and which are not. 
I have gathered 10 User Stories, please read each one of them carefully and then comment back here that which one is Ok with you and which one is not. 
Dear Shabeer
I have gone through the user stories and they are quite accurate.
However, In the first user story:
There are some words of CS terminology that can not be translated into the Dari language and won't give us the exact meaning that we need. 
As an alternative way, we also can have English to English translation for some words to provide the definition of that word for better understanding.
