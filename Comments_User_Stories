Dear All,

Kindly share your comments regarding the user stories here!

As a user
I want to rate the dictionary after using it
so that the developers could update dictionary based on my feedback
As the Product Owner I need to know which User Stories are feasible for you and which are not. 
I have gathered 10 User Stories, please read each one of them carefully and then comment back here that which one is Ok with you and which one is not. 

For instance this is one of the User Stories that I think should be considered for making the software: 

Title: Dictionary           Priority: High          Estimate: 5 Minutes
