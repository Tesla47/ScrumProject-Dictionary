Dear All,

Kindly share your comments regarding the user stories here!

Mr. Shabeer, 
I have gone through the user stories and they looked perfect. However, there might be some needs for changes i believe. if you dont mind

in the first user story:
since it is an English to Dari dictionary, most of the cs terminologies cannot directly be traslated to Dari. So i think it wont work that way.

in the seventh user story:
though the priority is low, but it still wont be possible to develop such dictionary to have millions of words. for this project, i think it would be better to go with 100 words maximam.

in the 10th user story:
it is good to have synonyms, antonyms, and examples. But instead of writing "for the searched word", i think it would be better to use "for complicated words", because there are some words 
which does not have any synonyms and antonyms.

... and can we have an option for rating the dictionary by the users too?!

Dear All,  

thanks for the hardwork and creating the repository. 

here is my idea for the user stories/ 


As a student 
I want to seach for the synonm of the words 
so that i can improve my vocublary skills for the words


As a teacher 
I want to search words pronounciation 
so that I can pronounce the words correctly 


as student 
I want to search for proverbs meaning
so that I can use them in the right way
