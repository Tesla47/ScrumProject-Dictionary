Dear All,

Kindly share your comments regarding the user stories here!

patch-4
As a user
I want to rate the dictionary after using it
so that the developers could update dictionary based on my feedback

I have read all the user stories and they all looked perfect
Just for the first one that i think it might not be possible to translate CS terms directly from english to dari because most of them do not have dari translations.
patch-3
Mr. Shabeer, 
I have gone through the user stories and they looked perfect. However, there might be some needs for changes i believe. if you dont mind

in the first user story:
since it is an English to Dari dictionary, most of the cs terminologies cannot directly be traslated to Dari. So i think it wont work that way.

in the seventh user story:
though the priority is low, but it still wont be possible to develop such dictionary to have millions of words. for this project, i think it would be better to go with 100 words maximam.

in the 10th user story:
it is good to have synonyms, antonyms, and examples. But instead of writing "for the searched word", i think it would be better to use "for complicated words", because there are some words 
which does not have any synonyms and antonyms.

... and can we have an option for rating the dictionary by the users too?!

Dear All,  

thanks for the hardwork and creating the repository. 

here is my idea for the user stories/
