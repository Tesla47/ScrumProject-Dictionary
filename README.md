# ScrumProject-Dictionary
This repository. is for the Scrum Project in which we (Emal Ismail, Muhhammad Yousuf Sultani, Muhammad Elyad Fikrat, Rayhana Amiri, Zahra Stanikzai, Sayed Shabeer Hashimi) will develop an English dictionary as a part of the project for the Softwaer Engineering-ITC 315 course. 

As a user
I want to rate the dictionary after using it
so that the developers could update based on my feedback

P.S. Mr.Shabeer,
You almost covered important things. Thanks for your effort!


Dear Shabeer,

I think you have covered all but I have also added some user stories please add them cause it will make the dictionary more better for the use like adding synonoms and proverbs feature to the dictionary
